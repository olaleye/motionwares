This project is a task assigned to me by Motionwares. I engineered it with Laravel Lumen; a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

The title of the task is - Use google cloud platform to natural language processing to perform sentiment analysis
